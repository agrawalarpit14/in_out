## Mini MVP hosted on http://15.206.84.149, www.ideabecho.co

There are many hackathons going on in India and many young engineers come up with wonderful ideas. However, most of these winning hacks are often never taken forward. On the other side, there are enumerous entrepreneurs attempting to start up in India sharing similar ideas and interests. However, a good majority of them lack the developer resource to transform their idea into a technology driven innovation.

Our Product is a web app, that attempts to bridge this gap between students and entrepreneurs. The winning ideas, along with the other ones are presented in our portal for startups to browse. A key thing to remember is WHILE IDEA matters in Hackathons EXECUTION matters in real world situations. Much like scholar.google.com that shows multiple papers in similar domains, we show multiple protoypes/solutions of similar ideas(in accordance with our startup's interests) and let them connect with engineers behind the best hacks. They can optionally offer a sum for the code/ tech behind the hack. This is a win win situation for engineers to earn quick cash and for startups to quickly access prototypes for their initial investing rounds. Best of all no hack is wasted!

The user scope and base for our product is ernomous and we would love to discuss more about our product in person. Our product is sort of the bridge between devfolio.co and angl.co
